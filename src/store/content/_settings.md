## Notebook Content

Add new files, rename, and delete them here.

- To delete, add a `"delete": true` property to a file in the editor.
- To rename, add a `"rename": "new-name.md"` property to a file in the editor.
- To apply the changes, click the Apply button on the viewer.
- To reset the JSON data to what it was before, click Reset on the viewer.
- Filenames must end with `.md` and `_newtab.md`, `_settings.md`, and `_welcome.md` cannot be deleted or renamed.
- A property `primaryComponent` may be added to a file and set to `edit` or `view`

## Permissions

[`permissions`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#Permissions)

```json
{
  "url": "",
}
```

## Environment

Enter environment information, such as account IDs and API keys here.

API keys and other secrets should not be stored in this document (on the editor side), but are instead stored in the session. If something is a secret, instead of including its value in this document, just include `null`. On the view side, you can enter it in and it will be stored in the session, until the tab is closed.

[`environment`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#Environment)

```json
{}
```

## Notebook View

Edit the tabs here.

- To add a tab, add a filename to tabs. It must be in the content above.
- To move a tab, just move the filename within tabs.
- To change the selected tab, put the filename under "selected".
- Settings can be left out because it can be added/removed by clicking the gear.
- The "lastSelected" property is used to restore the state in the settings toggle
  (the gear in the upper-right corner). It can be set to null, or left as-is.
  Currently it isn't validated and just ignored when hiding settings if it
  doesn't point to an existing file.
- To reset the JSON data to what it was before, click Reset on the viewer.

[`NotebookView`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#NotebookView)

```json
{
  "left": {
    "tabs": [
      "notes-example.md",
      "sandbox-example.md",
      "request-example.md"
    ],
    "selected": "request-example.md",
    "lastSelected": null,
    "show": "other"
  },
  "right": {
    "tabs": [
      "_welcome.md",
      "_settings.md"
    ],
    "selected": "_settings.md",
    "lastSelected": "_settings.md",
    "show": "self"
  }
}
```

## LocalStorage Tools

Use this to back up and restore the notebook data (including the content) in LocalStorage.
