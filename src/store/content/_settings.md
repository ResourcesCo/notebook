## Notebook Content

Add new files, rename, and delete them here.

- To delete, add a `"delete": true` property to a file in the editor.
- To rename, add a `"rename": "new-name.md"` property to a file in the editor.
- To apply the changes, click the Apply button on the viewer.
- To reset the JSON data to what it was before, click Reset on the viewer.
- Filenames must end with `.md` and `_newtab.md`, `_settings.md`, and `_welcome.md` cannot be deleted or renamed.
- A property `primaryComponent` may be added to a file and set to `edit` or `view`

[`NotebookContent`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#NotebookContent)

```json
{
  "files": {
    "_newtab.md": {
      "emoji": "üóÇ",
      "title": "New Tab"
    },
    "_settings.md": {
      "emoji": "‚öôÔ∏è",
      "title": "Settings"
    },
    "_welcome.md": {
      "emoji": "üëã",
      "title": "Welcome"
    },
    "notes-example.md": {
      "emoji": "üóí",
      "title": "Notes Example",
      "primaryComponent": "edit"
    },
    "request-example.md": {
      "emoji": "üåê",
      "title": "Request Example",
      "primaryComponent": "edit"
    },
    "sandbox-example.md": {
      "emoji": "üèù",
      "title": "Sandbox Example",
      "primaryComponent": "edit"
    }
  }
}
```

## Containers

[`containers`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#Containers)

Containers give pages access to storage, environment variables, and the network through rules.

```json
{
  "permissions": []
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

This allows the `request-example.md` file to make HTTP requests to `https://httpbin.org/post` and provides the environment variable `HTTPBIN_API_KEY` for use in `Authorization`. It can't directly access `HTTPBIN_API_KEY`. It is not scrubbed from the response, however, so because httpbin uses it, it can access it!

```json
{
  "containers": {
    "requests": {
      "pages": "request-example.md",
      "contentSecurity": {
        "httpbin.org": {
          "connect": {
            "headers": {
              "Authorization": {
                "env": {
                  "API_KEY": "${env.HTTPBIN_API_KEY}"
                }
              }
            },
            "confirm": true
          }
        },
        "jsonplaceholder.typicode.com": {
          "connect": true
        },
        "jsdelivr.net": {
          "script": true,
          "font": true
        },
        "placekitten.com": {
          "media": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment

Enter environment information, such as account IDs and API keys here.

[`environment`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#Environment)

```json
{}
```

## Notebook View

Edit the tabs here.

- To add a tab, add a filename to tabs. It must be in the content above.
- To move a tab, just move the filename within tabs.
- To change the selected tab, put the filename under "selected".
- Settings can be left out because it can be added/removed by clicking the gear.
- The "lastSelected" property is used to restore the state in the settings toggle
  (the gear in the upper-right corner). It can be set to null, or left as-is.
  Currently it isn't validated and just ignored when hiding settings if it
  doesn't point to an existing file.
- To reset the JSON data to what it was before, click Reset on the viewer.

[`NotebookView`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#NotebookView)

```json
{
  "left": {
    "tabs": [
      "notes-example.md",
      "sandbox-example.md",
      "request-example.md"
    ],
    "selected": "request-example.md",
    "lastSelected": null,
    "show": "other"
  },
  "right": {
    "tabs": [
      "_welcome.md",
      "_settings.md"
    ],
    "selected": "_settings.md",
    "lastSelected": "_settings.md",
    "show": "self"
  }
}
```

## LocalStorage Tools

Use this to back up and restore the notebook data (including the content) in LocalStorage.

[`LocalStorageTools`](https://macchiato.dev/component/#LocalStorageTools)

```json
{}
```
