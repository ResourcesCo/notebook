# Notes Example

This notebook can be used to type notes, that are saved to LocalStorage.

Remember to back them up! Go to Settings (the gear icon) and LocalStorage
tools and click Export.

Notes are in Markdown. CodeMirror adds new list items, including ones
with checkboxes:

## TODO

- [ ] write code
- [ ] buy groceries for dinner
- [ ] go for a walk
