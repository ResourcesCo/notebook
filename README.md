# Notebook

This is a work-in-progress prototype of a code notebook. The longer-running
project is at https://github.com/ResourcesCo/app - this is an attempt to
make a lighter weight code notebook with gitea as the backend, that would
be easier to self-host or run locally. It would log in with OAuth. I have
tried using Gitea as a local OAuth server, and it works quite well. On
Docker or Vagrant, or as a separate user, it would be protected from an
unprivileged script.
