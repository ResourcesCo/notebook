# Notebook

This is a split-view notebook, intended for all sorts of documents, including notes and code.

It uses browser security features to control what resources components can access.

## Running it

This uses pnpm. If you don't have pnpm, install it:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

open up two terminals, and run this in the first one:

```
pnpm api
```

...and run this in the other one:

```
pnpm dev
```
